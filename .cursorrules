# Cursor AI Rules

You are working on a governed Svelte project with strict rules.

## CRITICAL: Read These Files First

1. `AI_AGENTS.md` - Quick reference for AI agents
2. `GOVERNANCE.md` - Rule hierarchy
3. `svelte-mixed-migration-agent.md` - Complete migration rules
4. `PWA.md` - PWA requirements
5. `HTML_LIVING_STANDARD.md` - HTML rules
6. `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Color palette

## Core Rules (Never Violate)

- Editing a file ≠ Migrating it
- New code must be Svelte 5
- Only approved colors from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- PWA functionality must be preserved
- HTML must follow Living Standard (no `<div />`)
- STOP and ask if any rule would be violated

## Quick Reference

- Fix bug in Svelte 4? → Fix in Svelte 4, don't migrate
- New component? → Use Svelte 5
- Need new color? → Check DESIGN_SYSTEM.md first
- Touch service worker? → STOP and ask
- Unsure? → STOP and ask

See `AI_AGENTS.md` for complete instructions.
