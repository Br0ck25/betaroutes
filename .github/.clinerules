### SECURITY (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

- NEVER store passwords in localStorage
- NEVER log sensitive data
- NEVER use {@html} with user input
- NEVER trust client-provided userId
- ALWAYS verify user owns data
- ALWAYS read SECURITY.md when handling user data

### General

- Don't migrate files just because you're editing them
- New features = Svelte 5 only
- Only use approved colors
- Don't break PWA offline mode
- Generate valid HTML only
- STOP and ask when uncertain
