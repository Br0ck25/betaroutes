The AI must not introduce or use:



$: reactive statements

Svelte stores (writable, readable, derived, or custom)



Any legacy Svelte syntax or APIs



XHTML or XML-style HTML syntax



Required



The AI must always:



Use HTML Living Standard–compliant markup



Use Svelte 5 runes exclusively for reactivity
